# Summary

This project was created from cloning the 2.6.x branch of [Play Samples](https://github.com/playframework/play-samples).

The Starter Project makes a WebClient call to the REST API when hitting the homepage (http://localhost:9000).

The API runs on http://localhost:9001/v1/posts.  You can also send a POST, see details at the [REST API project](https://github.com/playframework/play-samples/tree/2.6.x/play-scala-rest-api-example).

## Running

Edit the `.env` file for the AppD portion of things.

If you want to build, run `docker-compose build`

Or you can just run with the images on Docker Hub using `docker-compose up -d`

Have Fun!
